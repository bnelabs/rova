- MCP SSE transport (MCPSSEClient) alongside existing stdio transport

### Changed
- Backend priority: nsjail > bwrap > rlimit > none

- BwrapSandbox conditionally grants network/filesystem per SandboxProfile

- StatusBarWidget with animated streaming indicator replacing static emojis
- Version bumped to 0.3.0

### Fixed
- Version mismatch between pyproject.toml and __init__.py
- _sync_request passing json kwarg to GET/DELETE (broke health, profiles)
- Sync send() not including tool_calls in history
- execute_python returning empty string for signal-killed processes
